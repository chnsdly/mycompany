## Customer Challenges: Range Anxiety and Efficiency Dead-Ends in Narrow Lanes

Hutong Express serves instant-delivery needs of convenience chains, community pharmacies, premium fresh stores and e-commerce platforms in Shanghai. Its fleet of small e-trikes and micro vans (0.6 t – 1 t) must run frequent, multi-stop routes.

### “200 km per Day” Range Shortfall  
Limited battery capacity plus heavy load, HVAC use and stop-and-go driving leave existing packs unable to finish daily routes, forcing mid-day charging and delaying deliveries.

### Charging Time Equals Lost Territory  
Couriers must squeeze in daytime top-ups at hubs or partner stores. Slow charging (4-6 h) slashes vehicle utilisation and orders per driver.

### Reliability Under Constant Bumps  
Old city roads—brick, cobblestones, narrow alleys—cause severe vibration. Some packs suffer loose connectors and rising BMS errors.

### TCO Pressure in Cost-Sensitive Operations  
Thin margins make the fleet highly sensitive to battery purchase, replacement and maintenance costs. Short life or frequent failures erode profits.

## Hengli New Energy Solution: Durable Power for “City Sprites”

For these constraints Hengli delivered a tailored **HL-M50** LFP solution:

### Higher Energy Density  
HL-M50 standard packs (~50-60 kWh) boost volumetric energy by 15 % within the same footprint, fitting mainstream e-trikes and micro vans.

### “Coffee-Break” Fast Charging  
1.5 C charging brings SOC from 30 % to 80 % in ≈ 40-45 min during lunch, maximising daytime uptime and eliminating long night charges.

### Reinforced Structure  
High-strength aluminium housing and shock-absorption design withstand high-frequency bumps; packs passed rigorous vibration testing.

### Ultra-Long Cycle Life  
Premium LFP chemistry and proprietary processes deliver > 3 500 cycles @ 80 % DoD, backed by a 5-year / 300 000 km warranty, lowering per-kilometre battery cost.

## Results: Small Size, Big Power—Efficiency & Cost Wins

Since phased adoption in H2 2023:

### Range Barrier Removed  
Real-world range now **220-250 km** (record **280 km**), eliminating mid-day anxiety and expanding service radius.

### Operating Efficiency Up  
- +**1.8 h** average effective operating time per vehicle  
- +**15 %** orders per driver; peak-hour capacity relief  
- Fleet uptime > **98 %** (was ≈ 92 %)

### Cost Down, Profit Up  
- **Energy:** > **60 %** cheaper than comparable ICE vehicles  
- **Maintenance:** battery-related fault reports down **40 %**  
- TCO advantage clear for low-margin micro-delivery business

### Zero-Compromise Safety  
Over a year of heavy-duty service (200 + km/day) achieved **zero** safety incidents, winning driver trust.

## Customer Testimonial
> “Hengli’s HL-M50 batteries truly solved our bottleneck. A quick charge over lunch gets us back on the road with peace of mind. Even Shanghai’s jolting old streets haven’t rattled them—fewer faults, easier maintenance, lower costs. Hengli’s team gets what our ‘ant-style’ delivery needs. These packs are partners we can rely on!”
