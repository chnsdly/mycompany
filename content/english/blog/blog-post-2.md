“Our products have been fully validated in China’s demanding market for safety, performance, and reliability, earning high recognition from our strategic partners,” General Manager **Wei Benlong** emphasized at the strategy kick-off meeting. “Global expansion is a strategic imperative for our growth and a testament to our confidence in both technology and products. We are fully prepared to create value for customers across diverse regions with an open mindset and professional service.”

### Core strengths of the overseas strategy

- **Technology-driven, product-centric**  
  Our flagship products adopt the advanced prismatic aluminum-case LFP pathway, offering outstanding safety, long life, wide temperature tolerance, and high consistency—perfectly matching global power-battery requirements. The platform is mature and stable, with performance on par with leading international standards.

- **Lean intelligent manufacturing, capacity assurance**  
  Industry-leading automated and intelligent production lines enable large-scale delivery and consistent quality, ensuring rapid response and high-volume supply to international markets.

- **Certification first, compliant operation**  
  We prioritize global market access rules. Core products are undergoing major international safety and performance certifications, including UN38.3, IEC 62619, and UL, ensuring compliance and paving the way for smooth market entry.

In the initial phase, expansion will focus on regions with strong demand for high-quality lithium batteries in light electric vehicles, while actively exploring diversified power applications abroad. We will increase brand visibility through international trade shows, deeper cooperation with overseas partners, and targeted marketing campaigns.
