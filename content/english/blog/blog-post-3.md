After years of deep cultivation in the new-energy power sector, we have reached another major milestone today: thanks to our leading technology and outstanding product quality, the company has secured a significant strategic order from Jeboo Power and has officially become its core lithium-battery supplier. This in-depth cooperation not only demonstrates strong market recognition of our solutions but also elevates our overall competitiveness in the power-lithium field to a new level.

A customer representative stated when the cooperation was confirmed: “We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of many suppliers and ultimately chose your company because of our strong confidence in your solid technical background, lean large-scale manufacturing capability, and product consistency. We look forward to building a long-term and stable strategic partnership and jointly promoting progress in power solutions.”

The core product of this cooperation is our market-proven, standardized lithium-battery platform. Centered on prismatic aluminum-case LFP cells, the series sets industry benchmarks for safety, energy density, cycle life, and environmental adaptability.

“Becoming a core supplier to an important strategic customer is a major leap in our company’s development,” said Chairman **Wei Benlong**. “It validates the rightness of our technical roadmap and the competitiveness of our products, while laying a solid foundation for exploring broader diversified applications. Seizing this opportunity, we will continue to increase R&D investment, deepen lean manufacturing, and optimize service, empowering global partners with safer, more efficient, and more reliable lithium solutions to drive the flourishing growth of green energy applications.”
